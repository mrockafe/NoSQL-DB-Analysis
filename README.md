# NoSQL-DB-Analysis
UK Food Standards Database Analysis with NoSQL 

## Description
- In this repository we have created a a full project using pymongo and pandas to perform analysis on a given json database for UK food standards
- To begin we must comit the json database into our mongo via terminal
- Once completed we use Jupyter Lab to pull in the mongo database
- With our database pulled in we may now edit, add, and clean up the database
- Once the data clean in the file "NoSQL_setup_starter.ipynb" is completed we may move to the analysis
